// this had two subclasses of SDLMusic, one which implemented formats
// (ogg, mp3, wav, etc.), the other which mucks about with SDL_Mixer's
// Mix_HookMusic() method for just nwa files.
//
// Jagarl used Mix_HookMusic along with his own loaders for all file
// formats. He did this because in the \#DSTRACK definition, there is
// a point in the file where you loop back to when the track
// ends. This is why ripped NWA files end so abruptly if you play them
// in a music player: they're designed to be looped forever and you
// can't get that effect with built ins.
//
// So instead of taking just jagarl's nwatowav.cc, I'm also stealing
// wavfile.{cc,h}, and some binding code.
