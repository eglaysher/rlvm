# - CMD_MUSIC: A unix specific hack that reads a waveform from an external
#   program
# - MOD_MUSIC: MOD files aren't needed
# - MID_MUSIC: MIDI files aren't needed
# - MP3_MUSIC / MP3_MAD_MUSIC: MP3 files aren't needed (and if you're looking
#   to reencode those big NWA files, use ogg.
# - OGG_DYNAMIC: We link with libogg; we don't root around in its shared object
#   with dlopen() after the fact.
