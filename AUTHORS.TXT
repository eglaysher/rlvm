Primary development by:

Elliot Glaysher <glaysher at umich dot edu>


Other code by:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Haeleth
- Wrote the original libReallive (rlvm is built on top of it)
- Wrote the kprl/rlc toolchain; used to compile the test cases
- Wrote several features

Kazunori "jagarl" Ueno
- Wrote file decoders for the majority of formats that RealLive and AVG32 use,
  which I have blatantly stolen, as they had BSDish licenses.
- Wrote the EF00 DLL emulation for Little Busters, which I have adapted for use
  in rlvm.

Rasqual Twilight
- Provided Win32 build files and several small bugfixes
