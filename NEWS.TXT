Version 0.14:                                                [2014-10-04]

- Support for the US edition of planetarian.
- Support for Kud Wafter.
- Further attempts to smooth animations and text output.
- Internal code cleanups and beautification; ported to C++11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.13.1:                                              [2013-12-15]

- Fix crash on the Clannad loading screen on certain OpenGL drivers.
- Fix order of font loading to prefer working fonts on Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.13:                                                [2013-10-13]

- rlvm will now warn on startup when it detects Japanese save data, but
  English patched game files, and offer to reset the save data. (This
  problem has been the number one support request for years.)
- Much better support for Little Busters. Most graphical glitches during
  the Little Busters Refrain have been fixed.
- TCC tone curve effects have been reverse-engineered and implemented
  (thanks to lurkmoar)
- Sepia scenes (and other graphical filters) should look much better.
- Simple shake commands implemented (fancy per-layer shaking still
  unimplemented).
- Make animations smooth: data should be uploaded to the graphics card
  before an animation loop starts, not while the animation loop is
  running.
- Fixes finding system fonts on Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.12:                                                [2011-05-14]

- User interface polish:
  - Display fatal error messages in a native dialog to user instead of
    just printing to the terminal.
  - Improvements to directory selector; complains if a directory isn't a
    game on Mac, shows a GTK+ selector on Linux.
  - Commissioned icon and better desktop integration on Linux.
  - Japanese localizations (and localization support for other languages).
  - Add nice messages instead of crashing on some error conditions
    (trying to play a game we don't know the encoding for, trying to
    play an AVG32 or Siglus game, etc).
- Fix graphics corruption in in-game dialogs when a dialog is brought
  up, and then fullscreen mode activated.
- Smooth the output of text in rlBabel using games.
- Don't play voice samples while fast forwarding.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.11:                                                [2011-03-06]

- Fix graphical defects in Clannad
- Implement voice replay buttons in scrollback
- Implement the "Return to Previous Selection" feature
- Fix volume controls. Each channel has both a user controlled and a
  programmer controlled volume knob; these are different and should be
  multiplied together.
- Several efficiency fixes. rlvm no longer spends 10% of its runtime
  searching the disk for files and only uploads dirty rectangles to the
  graphics card instead of sending the whole surface on every change.
- Fix the location of the name window in most games.
- Multiple fixes to automode and configuring automode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.10:                                                [2011-01-30]

- Support for Tomoyo After Memorial Edition.
- Voice support for Planetarian.
- Fix multiple errors in the handling of glosses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9:                                                 [2010-10-16]

- Preliminary support for Little Busters! No support for Ecstasy yet.
  - There are significant graphics glitches, but the entire game is
    completable to the end of the Refrain.
- Fixes saving the current graphics state in most games. Previously
  created save games can't be fixed, but new saved games should save
  their graphics state correctly.
- Fix regression in the original edition of CLANNAD's main menu.
- Hide unavailable options in select() calls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8:                                                 [2010-01-31]

- HIK animations have been reverse engineered and implemented:
  - Opening pan of the city in Planetarian now displays.
  - Many things that use HIK animations in the ALMA opening work.
- Weather objects have been reverse engineered and implemented and are
  used in pretty much every game I can find. They're used for snow,
  sakura petals, rain, balls of light, etc.
- Implement better line breaking for Japanese text.
- Fix color issues (blue displayed as red and vice versa) on some
  displays.
- Fixed multiple compatibility issues with the free demos on the Kinetic
  Novel website. Some demos are almost playable now; fully supporting
  them is an ongoing project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7:                                                 [2009-11-07]

- AIR Standard Edition can be completed.
- Princess Bride can be completed and Princess Brave maybe works.
- At least one route in ALMA can be completed.
- Fixes intermittent crashes after loading saved game.
- Prevent text boxes from being positioned offscreen.
- Implement shadows on text.
- Support KOE voice archives.
- Support loose ogg vorbis file voice patches (such as the one for
  KANON).
- Chinese and Korean rlBabel support compiled in by default. (I can't
  find any patches so this is untested).
- Large number of small graphical fixes, including faces in text boxes,
  visual appearance of #SELBTNs (such as in Fuuko's route), and various
  shading effects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.3:                                               [2009-08-15]

- Add fullscreen mode. Can be entered from game's interface or by
  hitting Alt+{F,Enter}.
- Internal changes to unit testing. (Now uses Google C++ Testing
  Framework, has code coverage, etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.2:                                               [2009-06-21]

- Bugfix release:
  - Fixes regression where G00 animations weren't being played (Seen in
    Planetarian.)
  - Fixes regression where Yumemi's face in the final scene in
    Planetarian was being drawn twice because of poor clip rect
    handling.
  - Support for English patches compiled with debugging symbols
    stripped.
  - Temporarily disables scrollback due to crash that will be invasive
    to fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.1:                                               [2009-05-22]

- Preliminary support of the CLANNAD_FV English patch:
  - Fixed multiple tokenization errors in rlvm's bytecode tokenizer.
  - Add support for floating name boxes.
- General CLANNAD_FV fixes:
  - Fix loading save games from the in game menu.
  - Fix display of two characters talking at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6:                                                 [2009-03-01]

- Lots of improvements to CLANNAD_FV:
  - Support newer mouse cursors
  - Support hierarchical objects (used in menus)
  - Implement support for voice in OVK archives. rlvm still does not
    read the older KOE and NWK archives.
- Support selection buttons (used during Fuuko's "donna itazura wo?"
  selections in CLANNAD)
- Note: rlvm currently doesn't work with the English patches released by
  the Baka-Tsuki CLANNAD translation wiki. There appears to be a problem
  parsing the bytecode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.5:                                                 [2009-01-17]

- There's now an implementation of rlBabel. This has only been tested
  with NDT's Kanon preview patch. It has not been tested with any of the
  patches from the Key Fan Club or any other Chinese or Korean patches.
- Fix a large number of graphical glitches including the calendar in
  Kanon blinking in and out and the CGs at the end of routes in CLANNAD
  not always clearing as the end credits are displayed.
- New Kanon save games will restore the graphical contents of the screen
  properly; old Kanon save files will show a black background. I wasn't
  recording the status of the graphics stack properly.
- Game info can be brought up by hitting [F1].
- Fix OpenGL 1.4 support; Version 0.4 only worked on OpenGL 2.0 or
  higher graphics cards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4:                                                 [2008-12-17]

- CLANNAD is playable from a clean file to the end of After Story True
  End; side routes and bad ends have not been tested.
- All routes in Kanon SE ALL are playable.
- There's now a partial default interface, allowing basic operations and
  a default save/load interface in games that don't provide their own
  (such as Kanon).
- NOTE: There is still no support for rlBabel; text in translation
  patches still won't display correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3:                                                 [2008-10-02]

- CLANNAD is playable through the end of Nagisa's route. CLANNAD Full
  Voice is still not supported; it uses new opcodes in the new menu
  system.
- Support for newer RealLive games that have individual XOR keys;
  CLANNAD Full Voice edition now boots up (though does little else).
- Replace name variables in text, such as '*A' as 'Tomoya' in CLANNAD.
- index_series: The function is now partially implemented; Kanon SE no
  longer enters an infinite loop during 'Last Regrets,' and CLANNAD Full
  Voice will get past the copyright screen.
- Reduce the memory footprint by keeping the last 100 pages of text in
  the scrollback buffer. Previously, the scrollback buffer was
  unbounded.
- Support CG commands; any game that includes a CGM file should now
  automatically track which CG images were viewed.
- Scrolling through previous pages of text no longer crashes
  Planetarian.
- Support for skipping previously read text.
- Fix performance on the CLANNAD main menu.
- Fix rare race condition between the audio thread and the main thread
  by grabbing the global SDL audio lock when

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2:                                                 [2008-06-24]

- WARNING: rlvm 0.2 breaks compatibility with version 0.1's save files!
  rlvm 0.2 will write save files in a different location.
- Support for background music and sound effects
  - Note: Character voices are still unsupported.
- Support for custom cursors
- Users can no longer resize the screen. Users could previously shrink
  the screen and not display all the contents, or they could enlarge it
  and have a large black empty area.
- Internal code cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1: (The first one!)                                [2008-04-16]

- Initial public release
- Planetarian is playable through the end.
